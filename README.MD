#Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

##Overview
This repo is for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data assignment.

There should be 3 files:
* The README.MD (this file)
* The CodeBook.MD
* run_analysis.R

In addition to the above files, you will required the data from The UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The the CodeBook.MD for details on where to get these data from.

##Configuration Settings
Before running the run_analysis.R script, you are required to set the working directory to the folder containing the extracted data from The UCI Machine Learning Repository.
This can be set on line 4 of the R Script. Make sure to save the change before running the script.

```{r}
#set working directory to the location where the Dataset was extracted
setwd("/Users/sijay2003/coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data/")
```
